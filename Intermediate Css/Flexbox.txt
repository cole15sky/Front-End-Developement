----------------------------Flexbox-----------------------------------
CSS provides many tools and properties that we can use to position elements on a webpage.
wanted will learn about Flexible Box Layout or flexbox, a tool that greatly simplifies how to position elements.

There are two important components to a flexbox layout: flex containers and flex items. A flex container is an element on a page that contains flex items. All direct child elements of a flex container are flex items. This distinction is important because some of the properties you will learn in this lesson apply to flex containers while others apply to flex items.

To designate an element as a flex container, set the elementâ€™s display property to flex or inline-flex. Once an item is a flex container, there are several properties we can use to specify how its children behave. In this lesson we will cover these properties:

justify-content
align-items
flex-grow
flex-shrink
flex-basis
flex
flex-wrap
align-content
flex-direction
flex-flow
Flexbox is an elegant tool that makes it easy to address positioning issues that may have been difficult before.
