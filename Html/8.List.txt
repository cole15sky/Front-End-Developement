-----------Unordered list ---------
 In addition to organizing text in paragraph form, we can also display content in an easy-to-read list.
In HTML, you can use an unordered list tag (<ul>) to create a list of items in no particular order. An unordered list outlines individual list items with a bullet point.

The <ul> element should not hold raw text and wonâ€™t automatically format raw text into an unordered list of items. Individual list items must be added to the unordered list using the <li> tag. The <li> or list item tag is used to describe an item in a list.

eg.
<ul>
  <li>sky</li>
  <li>land</li>
  <li>Air</li>
</ul>
In the example above, the list was created using the <ul> tag and all individual list items were added using <li> tags.

---------------Ordered list---------------
ordered list <ol> are like unordered list,except that each list items is numbered.They are useful when we need to list different steps in a process or rank item for first to last .
we can create ordered list with the <ol> tag and then add individual list items to the list using <li> tags.

eg.
<ol>
  <li>i am Aakash.</li>
  <li>I live in Lalitpur,patan.</li>
  <li> I'm a computer science student </li>
  <li>I'm from Chitwan</li>
</ol>
