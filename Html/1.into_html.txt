#Intro_html.
Html is the skeleton of all the webpage.
i.e Html provides the structure to the content appering on a website.
It's a Hypertext mark up language, where a mark up language is a computer language that defines the structure and presentation of raw text.


----------#html_anatomy ---------- 
A tag and the content between it is called an HTML element. There are many tags that we can use to organize and display text and other types of content, like images.
HTML element (or simply, element) — a unit of content in an HTML document formed by HTML tags and the text or media it contains.
HTML Tag — the element name, surrounded by an opening (<) and closing (>) angle bracket.
Opening Tag — the first HTML tag used to start an HTML element. The tag type is surrounded by opening and closing angle brackets.
Content — The information (text or other elements) contained between the opening and closing tags of an HTML element.
Closing tag — the second HTML tag used to end an HTML element. Closing tags have a forward slash (/) inside of them, directly after the left angle bracket.

<body>
<p> hello sky </p>
</body>

<p> = opening tag.
</P> = closing tag.
hello sky = content.
<P></P>= html elements.

-----------#The_body -------------
Key element of html we use to build a webpage is the body element.
placed inside the opening and closing body tags.
i.e <body> -------contents-------</body>
Once the file has a body, many different types of content – including text, images, and buttons – can be added to the body.

-----------#html_instructions --------
HTML is organized as a collection of family tree relationships. 
As  we placed <p> tags within <body> tags. When an element is contained inside another element,
 it is considered the child of that element. The child element is said to be nested inside of the parent element.

 [Note:Since there can be multiple levels of nesting, this analogy can be extended to grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and beyond. The relationship between elements and their ancestor and descendent elements is known as hierarchy.
 Understanding HTML hierarchy is important because child elements can inherit behavior and styling from their parent element]
