#Attributes
If we want to expand an element’s tag, we can do so using an attribute.
Attributes are content added to the opening tag of an element and can be used in several different ways, from providing information to changing styling. Attributes are made up of the following two parts:

.The name of the attribute
.The value of the attribute
.One commonly used attribute is the id. We can use the id attribute to specify different content (such as <div>s) and is really helpful when we use an element more than once. ids have several different purposes in HTML, but  focusing on how they can help us identify content on our page is important.

When we add an id to a <div>, we place it in the opening tag:
 
<div id="intro">
  <h1>Introduction</h1>
</div>
