If we want to dsiplay text in hmtl,we can use paragraph or span:
paragraphs<P> contains a block of plain text.
<span> comntins short pieces of texts or other html.They are used to seperate small pieces of content that are on the same line as other contents.
e.g:
<div>
  <h1>Technology</h1>
</div>
<div>
  <p><span>Sky learning </span> html css and js. </p>
</div>


In the example above, there are two different <div>. The second <div> contains a <p> with <span>Self-driving cars</span>. This <span> element separates “Self-driving cars” from the rest of the text in the paragraph.
It’s best to use a <span> element when you want to target a specific piece of content that is inline, or on the same line as other text. If you want to divide your content into blocks, it’s better to use a <div>.
