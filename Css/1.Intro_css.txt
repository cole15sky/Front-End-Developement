Basic syntax;
At the most basic level, css is made up of various rules. These rules are made up of a selectors(more on this a bit) and a semicolon-separated list of decleration, with each of those decleration being made up of a property-value pair. 
For example.
div.bold-text{ font-weight: 700;}
 div.bold-text = selector
 font-weight: = property

4.Grouping selector.
eg.
.read,
.unread {
  color: white;

<div>
  <div class="subsection header">Latest Posts</div>
  <p class="subsection" id="preview">

BY default an <img> elememnt's height and weidth values will be the same as the actual imge file's height and weidth.
so for this adjusting the size of the image without causing it lose its propositions use the 'auto' feature.

img{
    height:auto;
    width:500px;
}
For example, if an imageâ€™s original size was 500px height and 1000px width, using the above CSS would result in a height of 250px.
