Intro to Css.
Basic syntax;
At the most basic level, css is made up of various rules. These rules are made up of a selectors(more on this a bit) and a semicolon-separated list of decleration, with each of those decleration being made up of a property-value pair. 
For example.
div.bold-text{ font-weight: 700;}
 div.bold-text = selector
 font-weight: = property
 700; = value


Selectors.
1.Universal Selectors= *
Targeting all of the elements on the page has a few specific use cases, such as resetting default browser styling, or selecting all children of a parent element.
The universal selector uses the * character in the same place where you specified the type selector in a ruleset, like so:
* { 
  font-family: Verdana;
}
2. Type selector = div
3.Class selector <div Class="aakash-text">
-doesnot include angle brackets.
-since element types are often referred to by their opening tag name, the type selector is sometimes referred to the tag name or elemen t selectors.

                            ............ -> represented by (.) in css.
   ---------Multiple class---------
   We can add multiple classes to an HTML element’s class attribute by separating them with a space. This enables us to mix and match CSS classes to create many unique styles without writing a custom class for every style combination needed.
eg.
<h1 class='green bold'> ... </h1>
4.Id selector.

<h1 id='large-title'> ... </h1>
In contrast to class which accepts multiple values, and can be used broadly throughout an HTML document, an element’s id can only have a single value, and only be used once per page.
To select an element’s ID with CSS, we prepend the id name with a number sign (#). For instance, if we wanted to select the HTML element in the example above, it would look like this:

#large-title {

}

The id name is large-title, therefore the CSS selector for it is #large-title.Oftentimes it’s important to select a single element with CSS to give it its own unique style. If an HTML element needs to be styled uniquely, we can give it an ID using the id attribute.
<h1 id='large-title'> ... </h1>
In contrast to class which accepts multiple values, and can be used broadly throughout an HTML document, an element’s id can only have a single value, and only be used once per page.

ID selector = <div id = "learn-css"</div>
                         ......... -> represem=nted by (#) in css.



4.Grouping selector.
eg.
.read,
.unread {
  color: white;
  background-color: black;
}

5. Chaining selectors.
<div>
  <div class="subsection header">Latest Posts</div>
  <p class="subsection" id="preview">
    This is where a preview for a post might go.
  </p>
</div>
.subsection.header {
  color: red;
}
.subsection#preview {
  color: blue;
}

6.Descendent combinator.
combinator allows to combine muliple selectors differrently than either Grouping or cleaning them  as they show a relationship between the selectors. It will always

font-family:"Times New Roman", serif;
                               ..... --> incase If a browser cannot find or does not support the first font in a list, it will use the next one, then the next one and so on until it finds a supported and valid font. 
font-size:
font-weight:
text-align:

BY default an <img> elememnt's height and weidth values will be the same as the actual imge file's height and weidth.
so for this adjusting the size of the image without causing it lose its propositions use the 'auto' feature.

img{
    height:auto;
    width:500px;
}
For example, if an image’s original size was 500px height and 1000px width, using the above CSS would result in a height of 250px.

---------Adding css to html---------
