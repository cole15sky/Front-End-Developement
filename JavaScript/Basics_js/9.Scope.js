// ========================Scope=======================
// Scope essentially means where these variables are available for use.

// There are two types of scopes in JS:

 

// Function Scope: Visibility is limited to the function.
 function myFn() {

     var x = 10; 

     console.log(x); //prints 10

 } 

 console.log(x); // ReferenceError: x is not defined


 
// Block Scope: Visibility is limited to the block of code.
 if (true) { 

     let x = 10; 

     console.log(x); //prints 10

 } 

 console.log(x); // ReferenceError: x is not defined
 
 
// Now, that we have idea of scope. The scope of var, let and const.

// var declarations are function scoped.
// let declarations are block scoped.
// const declarations are block scoped.



// ============================Redefining and Redeclating features========================
// Redefining and Redeclaring feature

// A variable declared using ‘var’ can be redefined and even redeclared anywhere throughout its scope.

var x = 30;
console.log(x); //prints 30
x = "Hi"; //redefining or re-assigning (works without any error)
console.log(x); //prints "Hi"
 
var y = 10;
console.log(y); //prints 10
var y = "Hello"; //Redeclaring (works without any error)
console.log(y) //Prints "Hello"
 

// A variable declared using ‘let’ can be redefined within its scope but cannot be re-declared within its scope.

let x = 11;
console.log(x); //prints 11
x = "IB"; //works without any error
console.log(x); //prints "IB"

let y = 12;
console.log(y); //prints 12
let y = "Scaler"; // error: Identifier y has already been declared

let z = 13;
if(true){
   let z = "Fun"; //works without any error as scope is different.
   console.log(z) //prints "Fun"
}
console.log(z) //prints 13
 
 

// A variable declared using ‘const’ cannot be redefined or re-declared within its scope.

const x = 10;
console.log(x); //prints 10
x = 11; // error: Assignment to constant variable.

// const y;
// y = 2; //error

// const z = 12;
// console.log(z) //prints 12
// const z = 13; // error: Identifier 'z' has already been declared

// Every const declaration must be initialized at the time of declaration.
