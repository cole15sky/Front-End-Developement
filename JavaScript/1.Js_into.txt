         What is JavaScript?
Last year, millions of learners from the community started with JavaScript.
                Why?
 ------------> JavaScript is primarily known as the language of most modern web browsers, and its early quirks gave it a bit of a bad reputation. However, the language has continued to evolve and improve.
  JavaScript is a powerful, flexible, and fast programming language now being used for increasingly complex web development and beyond!

Since JavaScript remains at the core of web development, it’s often the first language learned by self-taught coders eager to learn and build. We’re excited for what you’ll be able to create with the JavaScript foundation you gain here.
 JavaScript powers the dynamic behavior on most websites, including this one.

Here  learning the introductory coding concepts including data types and built-in objects—essential knowledge for all aspiring developers will be explained. This foundation will set us up for understanding the more complex concepts we'll encounter later.
